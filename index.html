                Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or
                fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
                rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order
                to distinguish education from indoctrination.
                Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal
                education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims
                and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher.

                Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary
                in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation.
                Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to
                extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education
                developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.

                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[86] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece.

                Joseph Chimombo pointed out education's role as a policy instrument, capable of instilling social change
                and economic advancement in developing countries by giving communities the opportunity to take control
                of their destinies. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations (UN)
                General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new vision to address the environmental, social and
                economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
                including SDG 4 on education.

                Since 1909, the percentage of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before
                then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the twenty-first century, the majority
                of children in most regions of the world attended some form of school. By 2016, over 91 percent of
                children are enrolled in formal primary schooling
